# High Performance Teams

Recently on LinkedIn, one of long ago colleague posted a question on the lines of that made me think about my beleif and learnings of creating and fostering high performance team environments.

Following was my answer to the post. It seem to have resonated with quiet a few people.

> Give a clear goal, provide autonomy in execution, create a psycologically safe environment, build a sense of team and support them in their pursuit. Do this and you team will get anything that they set their minds on.

I called this my mantra for high performance teams. But you know what, it is not that you can create such teams just like that - like one day I walk into my office and with my new realisation over the weekend reading a LinkedIn post, I will today create a high performance team.

So, I thought it with more breaking down and highlight parts of this mantra and share my experience.

## Signifance of Clear Goal

At the crux of any high performance team is the goal. Without a goal the team need not exist. But where it gets tricky and often gets lost is making the goal clearly undersandable for everyone.

I personally find the monetory goals to be very tricky but usually common. Sometimes they don't get accompanied by any context that emphasises on what business values.

I don't think organisations lack context, I think they just fail to make it clear.

Consider this goal; _Generate revenue of $500,000 in the next one year_, set by company that is scaling and dreaming of exponential growth. It lacks crucial context that guides a team to take decisions.

While it might be obvious for the higher ups in the business that it is not acceptable to achieve it by taxing existing customers, unless this is cleary stated and communciated, chances are people are going to miss it. And we all know Murphy's law is so true.

And there is this that I keep repeating to my business people,
> we all hire smart people to solve problems in our business, if we are not making the problem obvious, damn! they are smart people and they are still going to solve _some problem_. You can only pray that the problem they solve helps the business.

So spend time to ask why to business outcomes, when people want something, they have reasons. Sometimes it is easy for themn to assume people know them or just that they are obvious.

In my experience _It surely pays to reason out and comprehnesively describe the purpose of goal._ as you know what at the end of day _people who work to achieve the goal take decisions everyday in effort to help achieve it and you don't want to leave there decisions subject to interpretation_.


Grown up people working in teams can understand that all goals are not noble.

When the goal is not noble enough and is not going with ones own personal values, It is a good idea to evaluate the room to influence the business on the rightful value and pursue it or leave the busienss sighting that as a reason.




#### Let them define the problem and the solution

Instead of taking task as a project, taking a perceived problem and an perceived outcome works good. It is similar to what is mentioned above as a learning problem.

It gives the team an opportunity to not just understand, but let's them explore the problem, discuss it, question it and engage with the problem.

Perceived problem and outcome provides a way for the organization to also share their intent effectively.

* Nurtures collaboration
* Gives the sense of ownership
* Motivates to achieve the outcome

And most of all engages them.

#### As leaders, don't solve the problem, support them to solve the problem

As leaders, it is easy to get down and solve a couple of problems for your team member. At best it only feeds the ego of the leader.

A better approach would be to support the team in solving a problem. Help them understand the missing bits and let them work out the solution for their problem. This provides an opportunity for your team members to learn while still having a sense of completion.

#### Create well defined goals & measures

Irrespective of the business domain or technology, every problem requires taking several decisions to solve. These decisions need not be limited to the outcomes, it could involve the execution strategy, coordination with other parts of business, customers, stake holders etc.

One can be only confident in making decisions if they know the purpose, values and measures of the business problem they are solving.

So work with them, collaborate and establish clear goals, measures and outcomes.

#### Give continuous feedback
