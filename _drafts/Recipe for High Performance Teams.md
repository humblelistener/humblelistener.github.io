# High Performance Teams

Recently on LinkedIn, one of my past colleague posted a question that made me share my beleifs and learnings from being part of as well as creating, tendering and fostering high performance teams.

Following was my answer to the post. It seem to have resonated with quiet a few people.

> Give a clear goal, provide autonomy in execution, create a psycologically safe environment, build a sense of team and support them in their pursuit. Do this and you team will get anything that they set their minds on.

I called this my mantra for high performance teams.

Given it resonated with quiet a few people, I thought there is worth in further furnishing details and explanations about each of these parameters in creating high performance team, so as to validate my learnings as well as help others to align what they understood and benefit each other.

## Word of caution

You know what, it is not that you can create such teams just like that - like one day I walk into my office and with my new realisation over the weekend reading a LinkedIn post, I will today create a high performance team. we all know that.

So, I thought it with more breaking down and highlight parts of this mantra and share my experience.

## Signifance of Clear Goal

At the crux of any high performance team is the goal. Without a goal the team need not exist. But where it gets tricky and often gets lost is making the goal clearly undersandable for everyone.

I personally find the monetory goals to be very tricky but usually common. Sometimes they don't get accompanied by any context that emphasises on what business values.

I don't think organisations lack context, I think they just fail to make it clear.

Consider this goal; _Generate revenue of $500,000 in the next one year_, set by company that is scaling and dreaming of exponential growth. It lacks crucial context that guides a team to take decisions.

While it might be obvious for the higher ups in the business that it is not acceptable to achieve it by taxing existing customers, unless this is cleary stated and communciated, chances are people are going to miss it. And we all know Murphy's law is so true.

And there is this that I keep repeating to my business people,
> we all hire smart people to solve problems in our business, if we are not making the problem obvious, damn! they are smart people and they are still going to solve _some problem_. You can only pray that the problem they solve helps the business.

So spend time to ask why to business outcomes, when people want something, they have reasons. Sometimes it is easy for themn to assume people know them or just that they are obvious.

In my experience _It surely pays to reason out and comprehnesively describe the purpose of goal._ as you know what at the end of day _people who work to achieve the goal take decisions everyday in effort to help achieve it and you don't want to leave there decisions subject to interpretation_.

## Autonomy in Execution

Once a goal is clearly defined, how a team executes this goal should be completely under the control of team.

To make a sense of it, lets take a step back,
Gone or those days where people are considered homogeneous resource. Successful leaders have learned that, every individual is unique, each have their strengh, weakness, opinions, preferences, personalities, which in essence qualify them.

Similarly, when a group of individuals come together, depending on the culture, background, individual qualities and personalities norms are formed. While they need to be fostered and cured towards a healthy culture, it is the fairly obvious that the strengths and weakness of these teams vary.

So, similar problem may require dealing different differently with different teams.

I don't thin anyone other than parents of young children can relate to this more. In my own family, I have two kids who have completely different way of getting things done. When I give a similar activity to them, they take different routes. Kavin gets more immersed into the activity and comes out successful and won't like to be disturbed till then. It demonstrates passion and focus. While Shakthi, is very social, she gets help, pleases people, gets work done while taking it easy. It should be noted that these qualities to change from time to time.

> Individual or team, they have unique qualities and personalities. To be successful one has to play to their strength. Giving that freedom to play any game for the personalities strength is what autonomy in execution is about.

Having said that, a few years back I would have told that team needs to be - "just autonomous". Ofcourse I have learned in the last few years that it is easy to strech the boundaries of autonomy and end up being in state where it is costly to fix or surface. Partly Leadership has an important play in it. However, I did learn that describing the boundaries of autonomy is important. While I like that High performance teams challenge the outcomes of the business, it is not acceptable to build an environment where teams take rogue decisions and not being transparent in communication. Hence it is important to define the boundary of autonomy per problem being dealt with. I personally found the execution independence to be a safe boundary to start with.

## Psychologically Safe Environment

Have you been in a situation like this before,

I used to have a colleague who constantly establishes his superiority in conversations. Every time after we finished a problem solving discussion or coding session, I always felt insignificant or plain dumb. I felt agitated and frustated coming out of the conversations. I infact can see how silly I have been and see how they are totally unlike me.

I took me a while to understand that there were several forces playing in such sessions. I seem to be constantly getting caught with trivial parts of conversation where superiorty and sense of pride were being manipulated triggering by my survival instincts and threat responses that I lost my nature and tried to hold ground for things that are petty and useless.

While in the hindsight, I consider such cultural misfits should be straight away avoided in teams - and organisations should hire for culture (seperae topic altogether), it could have well been the organisations set up and incentivation that lead to this (another topic altogether again)

It is important to keep in mind that in any situation _a team strengths should be greater than the sum of invidiuals._ Clearly not how it was with my experience above.

Personally it took me a while to handle such personalities. But I don't think they are necessary in the modern work place - the threat response, the animal instinct. We want individuals to be able to give their best and that threats and animal instincts are not how we want to stimulate them.

_It is true that animal instincts and threats do enable living beings to deliver beyond their normal capacity, like a Gazel dodging and escaping a Leopard. One has to keep in mind though that Gazel and Leopard do not have any commonality in their goal or they work together._

Having members of the team playing like that means that the net strength of a team falls below the sum of the individual strengths. This queit obviously does not help build a high performance team.

So, what do we do? It is worth ensuring that people are not threatened in their work place. They need to feel comfortable to share their thoughts, their opinions without feeling that they are manipulated of made fun of or being noted/ignored. They need to be able to present themselves without any concern, fear or worry. Only then they can bring their best.

It definitely requires moderation and coaching especially if this is fairly new to the team or organisation, It does take its norming time between members of the team.

Hiring for culture and Leaders in organisation have an important role in making it possible.

> A psycologically safe team is one where _the net strength of a team is not just greater that the sum of their individual strength but where it is exponentially higher.
> Diversity plays an important role in enabling this exponential strength.

## Building a sense of team

Providing Psycologically safe envinronent is a start. It is like a tendered and cured ground where diverse seeds are just starting to grow. They need moderation, they need to understand their roles in the game. They need to know that they are going to hunt together. They need to form that relationship. They need to understand each other. They need to be able to pick up, what is to ignored when said by a individual vs another. Learn and adapt to understand how inviduals express their thoughts, what is their norm etc. This happens in every relationship but teams are not an exception.

If not supported, they wll still form given a clear goal, good environment and good hiring practice, but it will take its own time. This stage is pretty much a curing stage - where it is only about enabling the teams.

Scrum and Agile processes excelled in this areas in the beginning of that era. Team building exercises, team outings, social functions, ceremonies help build them. They expedite the process of forming and norming.

A observer plays a important role in understanding the stages of forming and norming and facilitating that process - commonly labelled as a responsibility of scrum master or agile coach.

>When they are ready, they know how to hunt as a pack. They will know how to get work done leveraging individuals strengths and organise themselves around it.

### Revisit later

Grown up people working in teams can understand that all goals are not noble.

When the goal is not noble enough and is not going with ones own personal values, It is a good idea to evaluate the room to influence the business on the rightful value and pursue it or leave the busieness sighting that as a reason.

#### Let them define the problem and the solution

Instead of taking task as a project, taking a perceived problem and an perceived outcome works good. It is similar to what is mentioned above as a learning problem.

It gives the team an opportunity to not just understand, but let's them explore the problem, discuss it, question it and engage with the problem.

Perceived problem and outcome provides a way for the organization to also share their intent effectively.

* Nurtures collaboration
* Gives the sense of ownership
* Motivates to achieve the outcome

And most of all engages them.

#### As leaders, don't solve the problem, support them to solve the problem

As leaders, it is easy to get down and solve a couple of problems for your team member. At best it only feeds the ego of the leader.

A better approach would be to support the team in solving a problem. Help them understand the missing bits and let them work out the solution for their problem. This provides an opportunity for your team members to learn while still having a sense of completion.

#### Create well defined goals & measures

Irrespective of the business domain or technology, every problem requires taking several decisions to solve. These decisions need not be limited to the outcomes, it could involve the execution strategy, coordination with other parts of business, customers, stake holders etc.

One can be only confident in making decisions if they know the purpose, values and measures of the business problem they are solving.

So work with them, collaborate and establish clear goals, measures and outcomes.

#### Give continuous feedback
