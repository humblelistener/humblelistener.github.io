# Team Norms

Each team is unique, each individuals are unique, each problem is unique.

> The right norms, raises a groupâ€™s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright."

If only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declines.

Some norms to encourage and foster

* Team is having genuine fun
* They feel comfortable raisig their views
* Enthusiasm shown for one other idea

Some norms that shoyld be nipped in the bud

* Tension over superiority in the team
* One person or the same set of individuals speaking all the time

The biggest enabler of a team is that knowing someone has got their back - a leader will the one to back or buid that culture.
