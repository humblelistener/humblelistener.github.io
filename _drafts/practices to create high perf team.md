Following are some of the principles that align with the above mentioned path that I personally had success with.

#### Let them define the problem and the solution

Instead of taking task as a project, taking a perceived problem and an perceived outcome works good. It is similar to what is mentioned above as a learning problem.

It gives the team an opportunity to not just understand, but let's them explore the problem, discuss it, question it and engage with the problem.

Perceived problem and outcome provides a way for the organization to also share their intent effectively.

* Nurtures collaboration
* Gives the sense of ownership
* Motivates to achieve the outcome

And most of all engages them.

#### As leaders, don't solve the problem, support them to solve the problem

As leaders, it is easy to get down and solve a couple of problems for your team member. At best it only feeds the ego of the leader.

A better approach would be to support the team in solving a problem. Help them understand the missing bits and let them work out the solution for their problem. This provides an opportunity for your team members to learn while still having a sense of completion.

#### Create well defined goals & measures

Irrespective of the business domain or technology, every problem requires taking several decisions to solve. These decisions need not be limited to the outcomes, it could involve the execution strategy, coordination with other parts of business, customers, stake holders etc.

One can be only confident in making decisions if they know the purpose, values and measures of the business problem they are solving.

So work with them, collaborate and establish clear goals, measures and outcomes.

#### Give continuous feedback
