For all those who did not know..

I left Mindtree early May 2013 and joined Readify in Melbourne, Australia.

I should call myself very fortunate to have secured a job while still ashore from Oz and to have joined this company.

The best thing I can tell about Readify is the people.

Most of them are `MVP` in other or the other area.

The environment and people are more welcoming than I actually expected. The organization has a friendly and open culture and puts real efforts in the professional development of the consultants.

There are various programs and options available in the organization to quench all the type of thirst a software engineer could have.

Readify has been on the Great Places to Work in Australia Institutes list of companies consistently for the last 3 or 4 years.
This year (2013) it was positioned at 15.

Readify is the awarded the Partner of the year across world from Microsoft to their contribution to the Microsoft ecosystem.

So, I started with them this May and have already touched upon a couple of gigs.. one for the Port of Melbourne corporation and another for seek.com.au.

Currently in the seek.com.au's gig, I am working along with highly motivated Seek's team to develop their website.


In this role, I will be using my client side MVC knowledge and experience are to be leveraged, which I am looking forward this as an opportunity to hone my skills in this space and learn a few interesting and new client side frameworks and tools. 

Catch you all in the next blog... thanks for reading..
