# Organisations existence

Most of the organisations seem to exist to fill the gap in helping people and world solve a particular problem - if it is not an obvious problem, it then becomes the organisations role to educate the existence the problem which they solve. I call it their reason for existence.

To give some simple examples,


### LinkedIn
The follow is a quote from [LinkedIn's culture and values page](https://careers.linkedin.com/culture-and-values).

_Creating a digital map of the global economy to connect talent with opportunity at massive scale._

### Twitter
They call it their [mission](https://about.twitter.com/company).
_Our mission: To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers._

### Google
Mission is what they call it (interestingly [it is accessible only from google search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=google+about&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU732AU732&oq=google+about&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3533j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)),
_Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful._

## How do organisations approach it
Every organisation has different ways to define their purpose. Some call them vision, some mission, some simply put together a statement.

I found how my previous employer [Mindtree](www.mindtree.com) did it quiet interesting.

They used to have a vision statement, a value statement and a mission derived from the vision statement that addresses the medium term.
Back in the days, then chairman [Respected Mr. Ashok Soota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashok-soota-7298/) used to walk every employee through the "Vision, mission & values" session.

Recently they seem to have alignt to Mission and Values.

### Mindtree's mission
Sounds a bit too vague to me.
_We engineer meaningful technology solutions to help businesses and societies flourish._

### Mindtree's values

_COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT
Mindtree believes in developing true partnerships. We foster a collegial environment where individual perspectives are respected and honest dialogue is expected._

_UNRELENTING DEDICATION
Mindtree is driven to meet client needs with determination and grit. We embrace tough challenges and do not rest until the problem is solved, the right way._

_EXPERT THINKING
Mindtree brings robust skills and forward looking perspectives to solve customer challenges. We use proven knowledge to make recommendations and provide expert guidance to our customers._

### One last old school mission, vision and values statement from the very old BBC

Mission
_To enrich people's lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain._

Vision
_To be the most creative organisation in the world._

## Trend towards sustainability and social responsibility

Corporate social responsibility and sutainable business practice are other differentiators that organisations bring to the market.

To me, the mean more - they mean as some wiseman once pointed out,

_People don't just buy products anymore, they buy into values they represent._

## What do workers buy in?

If values are the one that are bought in for even just day do day products, what about the work.

**To me, I am spending best part of my life working, I better have a clear and convincing buy in to the business - its mission and values it represents.**

Else it is as good as calling it _a life wasted._
