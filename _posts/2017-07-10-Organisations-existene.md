# Organisations existence

Most of the organisations seem to exist to fill the gap in helping people and world solve a particular problem - if it is not an obvious problem, it then becomes the organisations role to educate the existence the problem which they solve. I call it their reason for existence.

To give some simple examples,


### LinkedIn
The follow is a quote from [LinkedIn's culture and values page](https://careers.linkedin.com/culture-and-values).
> Creating a digital map of the global economy to connect talent with opportunity at massive scale.

### Twitter
They call it their [mission](https://about.twitter.com/company).
> Our mission: To give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.

### Google
Mission is what they call it (interestingly [it is accessible only from google search](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=google+about&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU732AU732&oq=google+about&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3533j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)),

> Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.

## How do organisations approach it
Every organisation has different ways to define their purpose. Some call them vision, some mission, some simply put together a statement.

I found how my previous employer [Mindtree](www.mindtree.com) did it quiet interesting.

They used to have a vision statement, a value statement and a mission derived from the vision statement that addresses the medium term.
Back in the days, then chairman [Respected Mr. Ashok Soota](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashok-soota-7298/) used to walk every employee through the "Vision, mission & values" session.

Recently they seem to have alignt to Mission and Values.

### Mindtree's mission
Sounds a bit too vague to me.
> We engineer meaningful technology solutions to help businesses and societies flourish.

### Mindtree's values
>COLLABORATIVE SPIRIT
Mindtree believes in developing true partnerships. We foster a collegial environment where individual perspectives are respected and honest dialogue is expected.

>UNRELENTING DEDICATION
Mindtree is driven to meet client needs with determination and grit. We embrace tough challenges and do not rest until the problem is solved, the right way.

>EXPERT THINKING
Mindtree brings robust skills and forward looking perspectives to solve customer challenges. We use proven knowledge to make recommendations and provide expert guidance to our customers.

### One last old school mission, vision and values statement from the very old BBC

Mission
>To enrich people's lives with programmes and services that inform, educate and entertain.

Vision
> To be the most creative organisation in the world.

## Trend towards sustainability and social responsibility

Corporate social responsibility and sutainable business practice are other differentiators that organisations bring to the market.

To me, the mean more - they mean as some wiseman once pointed out,

> People don't just buy products anymore, they buy meaningful experiences

Something I can fassociate my value with.
